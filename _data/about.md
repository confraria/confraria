I've been building for the web for over 20 years. For the majority of this time I've been a 'Front-end developer' but my range of skills is quite broader. Although where I can deliver most value is bridging the gap between design and develop, I can move confortably along the stack.
Like to think the big picture but always feel the strong need to understand how the little pieces work in detail.
