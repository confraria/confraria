I used to make fun people that insisted to keep their own NAS at home, instead of just using the cloud or a cloud service, where just dorks with too much time on  their hands.
Recently I've started to think that we don't really own this data if we don't fully control it.

My runs on runtastic, the articles I want to read on get pocket, the podcasts on pocket casts, my tweets, my lost bookmarks on delicious, the photos on google photos.
I have no control over this and eventually I'm going to loose it.

Also the realisation that these apps store very simple data. In fact, if we looks at these as individual systems, we can store almost all of this information in simple text files.

Information I want to store:

- Notes
- Todos
- Get pocket
- Podcasts
- Running / Exercise
- Event tracking
