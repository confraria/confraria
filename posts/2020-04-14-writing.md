title: Writing

Writing seems to be very good for you. A little bit like broccoli, or anti oxidants. Half of the self-help gurus will swear on the benefits of journalling and every thought leader will tell that writing is an effective tool to organize your thoughts.

I've been planning to start writing for years, but as a black belt procrastinator that I am, always failed to even attempt a few paragraphs.
To make things worts, I probably didn't have any desire to write, but only the desire to be read. Which seems like a very modern dilema to have.

In the past couple of months the idea of writing has been coming back to me. I start sketching articles in my head and ride this wave of excitement that inevitably comes crashing into the realisation that: it's very unstructured, doesn't make much sense, someone said it better, or sometimes all of the previous.

There are times when not doing anything is worst than taking the wrong step. So here I am, writing. I watched a Tim Ferris' video that suggested: two crappy pages per day. I'll stop already after a few paragraphs. You've got to start somewhere, yet they surely are crappy.
