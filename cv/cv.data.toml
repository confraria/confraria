👋 Hi there, I'm Luis. <br>
I've been building for the web for over 20 years. For the majority of this time, I've been a 'Front-end developer' but my range of skills is quite broader.
Although where I can deliver most value is bridging the gap between design and development, I can move comfortably along the stack.
Like to think the big picture but always feel the strong need to understand how the little pieces work in detail.
Very used to working remotely and communicating with distributed teams in multiple timezones. I'm familiar with both startup and enterprise development environments.
